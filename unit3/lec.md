## Capitalism as a social process
* Social relations & cultural beliefs = function of economic system
    * Identity, social class function of sys.
* Utilitarian assumption built into capitalism, social contract
* Use value → value in subsistence societies

# 3/22/19
## Capitalism in the American West
* High risk investments high risk returns from foreign countries

### Markets
* Supply markets, finance, consumer markets
* Marketplace of ideas (technologies)
    * Train symbol of progress
    * Electricity/telecommunications
* Labor markets
    * Capital owning mode of production → hiring waged labor
    * Free wage labor: free from encumbrances of land ownership, etc.
    * Recruitment of labor all over world
* Property laws → security of tenure
* Fed./state gov't favors certain capital investments
* Liberalism: freedom in marketplace
    * Minimal regulation focus on opening up trade
* Crises of reproduction → lack of labor supply → high wages

## Richard Walker
* Richard Walker, Marxist geographer
* From extraction based to diversified manufacturing/resource economy
* Industrialization = heart/soul of modern production
* Exploitation of natural resources → long term growth in CA
* Surplus value circulates/accumulates in CA economy
* No rapid extraction/exhaustion of resources supply

## California's Property Regime
### Prospector Capitalism
* Discovery/extraction
* Cultural values around unconstrained use of resources
* No concern about externalities/social costs

### Petit-Bourgeoisie
* CA → many people w/ skills ambitions, highly literate from East Coast, native born Whites
    * Consummate modernists, measured everyone/thing in terms of money

### Relationship Between Small/Large Capital in CA
* Preconditions for large-scale accumulation
* Large scale many advantages, small = willing to take many risks
* Dialectic between small holders and eclectic bourgeoisie

### Regional Capital Accumulation
* Accumulation of capital essential to development of state
* Resources wealth → money in local hands → capital stocks in SF
* Retaining value regionally → strongly depended on property rights
* Competition between SF/NY and SF/OAK

### Resource Industrialization
* CA mining technology manufactured on large scale in SF, used regionally,
    exported throughout world
* State fundamentally conservative in CA
    * Removal of native people, low taxes, development of resources by state
        for economic development
    * Focus = supporting industry/economy

# 4/1/19
## Migration Terminology
* Migration = w/in national borders
* Rural migration from rural to urban
* Chain migration (anchor baby)
* Incorporation
    * Pluralist = don't need to acculturate before assimilate

## Push factors
* Power of state not very effective in region
* Pearl river delta → long term leases
    * Divisible inheritance
* Political instability assoc. w/ war = driving factor
    * British driving instability in effort to capture market for textile
* Opium Wars
    * British wanted to sell textiles/opium in China
    * War indemnity (in cash) → untenable situation
* 20-30 million killed Taiping Rebellion
* Dispossession of land via taxation

## Pull factors
* Desired as politically disempowered labor

## Means
* Settlement communities created means

## Demography
* Lower economic strata

# 4/3/19
## Geography
* Placer deposits of gold at bottoms of rivers

## Mining Timeline
* Sutter = social engineering idealist

## Mining, Technology
* Opportunities for waged labor diffuse and disappear
    * Not-accessible, esp. for non-whites
* Emergence of new labor regime based on labor markets keeping costs down
* Limiting opportunities for upward mobility (wage workers)

## Chinese in the minerals economy
* Sweep through abandoned mines
* Initially work in provisioning (providing food, fish, etc.), traditionally done by
    women (e.g. restaurants)
* Foreign miner's tax primarily on Chinese miners
    * Also on Sonoran?

## Ecology of Gold Mining
* Farmers in central valley against North Bloomfield mine (hydraulic mine),
    injunction against hydraulic mining (agriculture \> mining in CA economy)

## Mercury \& Abandoned Mines
* Mercury used to amalgamate w/ gold in pans → capture gold, mercury ran
    downstream (SF bay)

# 4/5/19
## The first transcontinental railroad
* Civil war → transcontinental railroad funding
* Central Pacific goes from Sacramento → east
* RRs = ~15% of timber market

## Financing the Railroad - the states and private capital
* Long in making, precipitated by interests in west
* Sell off RR land, land = collateral on loans

## Federal Railroad land grants
* Graft/corruption → bonds $>$ \$ $>$ land
    * Bonds $<$ \$ $<$ land

## America's Errand into the Wilderness: Race, resources, labor, \& capital in the American West
* Security of property rights central to prospector capitalism
* Walker (prospector capitalism) leaves out proletarian immigrant labor force (not his main focus)
* Takaki complements Walker from immigrant labor perspective
    * More secular vision than Winthrop city on a hill
    * Natural resource development reflect population dynamics
        * Quasi-mythical mission
        * Conquest (Manifest Destiny), settlement (agrarian myth)
* Manifest destiny rationalizes separation among white supremacist lines
    * Inclusionist myth (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant)
* Errand into wilderness → what happens after territorial control already
    established
    * Progress = bringing Western idealism & vision
    * More focused on development of economy, natural resources
    * Incorporation of diverse racial groups
    * More melting pot inclusionist
    * Incorporation into economy in way that serves capital
* Both call for physical transformation of nature, organize society in certain
    ways to achieve those ends
    * Agrarian myth = Lockean
        * Equitable distribution of land
    * Exploitation of labor via marginalization
* Prospector capitalism → crisis of reproduction
* Grounded in traditions of secular Protestantism
    * Working for glory of God/country (manifest destiny)
* Need cheap labor to develop land and finance
    * "Get labor first, capital will follow"
    * Low-cost, politically dis-empowered, disposable labor
        * Race encoding access to opportunities
    * Racial formation in American West grounded in need for capital for low-cost, politically dis-empowered, disposable labor
* 1898 US takes over Philippines

# 4/8/19
## Law \& Policy
* Policy reflects (understood of) social construction of Chinese, role in
    economy, \& conflicts between Chinese \& European (Irish) in broader context
    of conflicts between capital and labor
* Conflicts between capital and labor = dynamo of social change
* Immigration regulated exclusively by Fed. gov't, 1875, 100 yrs. prior
    governed by states
* Congress given authority for naturalization process
    * 3 Naturalization Acts
    * Any alien free white person can be naturalized after 5 years resident in
        U.S.
    * Non-whites excluded from naturalization until 1952 (McCarran-Walter Act)
* 1840s/50s SF mayor (Geary) welcomes Chinese ("celestial men of commerce")
* 1853 first strong wave of anti-Chinese sentiment
    * Discovery of gold in Australia → ↓ gold markets
    * Tied to changes in labor market, conflicts between Irish workers \&
        Chinese workers
* 1854: People v. Hall Chinese can't testify
* 1860s: Shifting economic situation in CA, strong economy associated w/
    production for Union in Civil War
    * Manufacturing ↑, opportunities in agriculture \& railroad for Chinese
    * Chinese working in productive niches, not in conflict w/ whites
* Downturn in economy → big anti-Chinese legislature
* 1868: 14th Amendment
    * Citizenship clause (all people born in US are citizens under birthright
        citizenship)
        * Overturns 1857 Dred Scott case
        * Applies primarily to freed slaves
        * Doesn't apply to Native Americans until 1984
    * Due process clause (prohibit states/gov'ts from depriving persons of
        life/liberty/property w/out certain steps assured via due process)
        * Extend Bill of Rights
    * Equal protection under law (basis for Brown v. Board of Education)
        * Disassemble Jim Crow laws in 1960s)
        * Opens up possibilities for opening lawsuits against jurisdictions
* 1870s: No discrimination voting rights
    * Chinese question starting from point of sympathy, understanding to much
        more anti-Chinese posture (first state, then national level)
        * Transcontinental RR finished → flood of Chinese in SF → worries
* 1870: Naturalization Act → all foreign born Chinese/Asians = aliens
    ineligible for citizenship
* 1873-1877 → intense depression, particulary strong in CA
    * Economic upturns/downturns, originally called Great Depression (renamed
        to Long Depression)
        * Devastation to economy in West, collapse of many RR corporations,
            unemployment (26%)
    * 1875: Page Act, Chinese/Japanese/felons/contract laborer → first exclusion of national
        group from U.S.
        * Prevent family formation for Chinese in CA/West
            * Contract laborer → most often women
        * Chinese denied vote/access to state
* 1877: Workingman's Party, Dennis Kearny
    * Saw Chinese as problem to be taken care of via legislation
    * "Chinese must go" → not taking off until 1880s
* 1882: Chinese Exclusion Act, 10 yrs.
    * Forbid all laborers/women (merchants still allowed)
    * Loophole = Chinese residents can come/go, those w/ relatives in U.S. can come → uptick in immigration
* 1888: Scott Act barred re-entry of non-citizens
* 1892: Geary Act extends Chinese Exclusion Act another 10 yrs. need resident
    papers
* 1898: U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark
    * Denied citizenship by ports in U.S.
* 1910-40: Angel Island Immigration Station
    * Paper sons/daughters (often false documents)
* 1924: Immigration Act, allowed immigration from China
* 1952: McCarran-Walter Act, all restrictions on naturalization based on race lifted (still
    immigration restrictions)
* 1965: Immigration Act, lifted racial restrictions on immigration

# 4/10/19
## Strategies for coping/resistance
* Incorporation into economy
* Gary Okihiro, *Extending Democracy's Reach*
    * Asian-Americans → resistance = effort to become incorporated in American
        economic/social/political/cultural life
    * Pluralist framework, acculturation doesn't have to be full but
        assimilation can be
    * Moves beyond classic multi-culturalist perspective
    * Contributing to economy \& democracy
    * Court cases, fighting for rights → Civil Rights Movement
        * Extended democratic beyond their own community

## California Delta
* Poor/risky site, great situation
    * Between SF \& interior of state → great situation (market, transportation
        infra)
        * Great agriculture potential, fertile soil, water year-round, most productive landscape worldwide
        * Limited appeal → malarial cholera infested swamp
        * Inverted deltaic fan wetland
        * Before 1850: floodplain, tidewater marsh, changing volume of
            fresh/salt water (water from bay \& interior of state), natural
            levies, islands, silt
            * Landscape rearranged annually
            * Subsidence alluvial soils, annual recharge necessary
            * Annual deposition of tule grass into soils → incredibly fertile
* After 1850 → artificial modifications
    * Hydraulic mining → floods
    * Deforestation → not retaining water
    * Entire Central Valley flooded
    * Levies built, no recharge of sediment → tremendous subsidence
        * Lots of areas below sea level
    * Big problem w/ saltwater intrusion
        * Less flow into delta w/ climate change
    * A lot of water pumped to SoCal → catastrophe in delta
* Buildup of residential areas, prone to earthquakes → very risk
* Yearly floods
* Water resource management via delta

## Reclamation \& delta farming
* Potentially great for farming but needed reclamation
    * Attractive to capital, but need to mitigate risks of investing into place 
* Recruit cheap labor, introduce new tech, efficiencies, scaling etc.
* Role of state essential → mitigates risk via subsidizing development via
    cheap land \& low wage labor force
    * Giving away land nice on paper, not so nice in reality
* 1850: Arkansas Swamp Act → national wetlands act
    * Fed. gov't gave CA 2.2 million acres, .5 million in delta "swampland"
        * given as grant
        * State could sell if used \$ to fund reclamation
    * Series of bills through state legislature → disposal of land via small
        parcels 
        * No resale → prevent speculation \& concentration of land holdings
            * Pressure to open limits → w/in 10 years no limit on land state
                can dispose to private individuals
            * Nature of resource → greater \& greater scale of operations
                * Initially small, but new areas require new methods, difficult
                    to reclaim based on small parcels
                    * Greater capital requirement and need for larger labor
                        force \& new technologies needed for reclamation
        * Initially small scale prospector capitalism → transition to larger
            scale operations (land/labor force/technology)
            * Errand in Wilderness (Takaki)
                * Natural resources development required large scale of
                    capital, technology, etc.
                    * Concentration of land ownership, class based wage/labor
                        system
            * Plays out in 2 periods, reclamation \& agricultural development

## Reclamation - Phase 1
* State sells to white landowners (small holders)
    * 100 some acres, smaller parcels
    * Labor recruitment of Portuguese/Italian/Chinese workers
    * Plug into labor recruitment networks for mining/RR
        * Niche opportunity after done w/ RR
* Poor working conditions, 120 deg. in summer, malaria, etc.
* Struggles over remuneration
    * Clay pillar jankiness
* Reclamation district pay for levees via taxes
* Bartlett pears good for lasting in soggy ground

## Reclamation - Phase 2
* Clamshell dredge re-purposed from mining
    * Labor lower
        * Fewer opportunities, recruitment of non-Chinese technicians
    * Corporate capital pooled, accumulation of wealth in LA (from oil/gas
        industry)
* Subsidization via reclamation districts
* Asparagus, pear → hard on land
* Reclamation of land → tenancy for Chinese workers

## Chinese tenancy in the Delta
* 2 periods of overlapping tenancy
* Phase 1 → Chinese (along for Portuguese) work land → can now acquire access
    to land
* 1880s/90s: established Chinese rural communities
* Leases/lease-holding = capital \& leaseholders struggle over benefits and
    costs (risks/opportunities)

### Clicker
* Answer = B

### 2nd phase of Chinese tenancy
* Larger landholders
* Run out of opportunities w/ alien land laws changing things
* Reclamation → tenancy (high desire for agricultural operation)
    * Labor builds value
    * Chinese = culturally well prepared (history of work in Pearl River delta,
        RR, mining)
        * Bring technologies, labor recruitment network
        * Rotation credit associations, short term loans
        * Cultivate relationships w/ white landowners
    * Developmental leasing → work done by leaseholder done by first couple
        years
* Serves as Jeffersonian wedge into land tenure system in CA (that otherwise
    excluded Chinese)

# 4/12/19
## Japanese Migration
* Meiji emperor = connection between tradition and modernity
* Focus on industrialization, urbanization, \& militarization
    * Most rapid period of industrialization
* Linking w/ Western industrialists, etc.
    * Bring home knowledge of Western technology \& practices
    * RR, naval tech, manufacturing tech
* Transformation of politics, economy, labor system
    * Pursuing opportunities in city → massive rural migration to cities
    * Industrialization of labor force
    * Increase in standard of living lifespan, population/demography
    * 1860: 30 million Japan, 38 million by 1888, 80 million by 1940
* Militarism = key feature of industrialization
    * Wars w/ China in 1894/95
    * Korea = protectorate of Japan
    * Defeated Russia
    * Geopolitical/military force
* State generating revenues, managing economy, taxes
* Imposition of national land tax → hits subsistence land farmers
    * Farmers faced w/ tremendous financial problem
    * Farmers have relatively large landholdings (due to inheritance
        distributions)
        * Particle/divisible inheritance → drove people out
        * Oldest son receives all of land (primogeniture)
        * Pull factors into city
        * Dispossession of land
* Gov't policy = driving force
    * Immigration initially forbidden
    * Gov't saw need for remittances → changed policy
    * Permitted recruitment of labor from U.S. and others (Hawaii)
    * Policy oriented towards sojourning, deliberate focus on establishing
        settlement communities oversea → serve as base for chain migration,
        means for learning about/bring back tech/knowledge to Japan, generating
        remittances
        * Driven around gaining access to tech, maintaining pride/prestige/honor
            on world stage, rising nationalism
* Series of waves of immigration from different countries (China, Japan,
    Philippines, Punjab)
    * Come in w/ lower wage rate than previous group
* 1884: Right after Chinese Exclusion Act
    * Japanese gov't screen people sent, send women, etc.
        * Saw problems w/ Chinese immigration
            * Development of bachelor society seen in negative light
        * Women as projection of national character, greater stability, family
            formation, reproduction of settler communities
* Pull factors: need for cheap wage labor in agriculture
    * Chinese discriminated against → opportunities
* Migration to U.S. starts w/ migration to Hawaii
    * Working in sugar → move to CA
    * Primary destination = LA (development of oil/gas industries)
    * 2nd city = Seattle, then Vancouver/British Columbia, Bay Area

## Demography
* Experience managing small farms, technological experience of Japanese
    agriculture
    * Came w/ great deal of experience
    * Entrepreneurial ambitions, skills/tech. knowledge to realize them
    * Sense of identity as Japanese, strong sense of ethnic pride
        * Chinese identity forged in U.S. (previously more clan-centered)
* Women almost as much schooling as men
* 1905: 7% of Jap. pop. in U.S. = women
* Largest age cohort = 45-65 (1920)
    * Came at 1880, age 17/18
* Women coming 10-15 yrs. younger
* First men, then women, fewer women
* 1870: Naturalization Act → Issei ineligible for citizenship

## Issei Occupations/Niches
* Fish canneries in Seattle
* Later more farmers

## Federal
* Almost immediately vilified \& seen as threat by whites
* 1906: Asiatic Exclusion League → SF school board, Asian children must be sent to sep.
    oriental school
    * Japanese gov't angry
    * School board lets Jap. children continue attending white schools
    * Gentleman's Agreement → Jap. no longer issue exit passports to men labors,
        loopholes for family members, etc. (picturebrides)
        * Men resident in U.S. able to bring family
        * Explosion of picturebrides, via marriage brokers
* Ladies' Agreement bans picturebrides

## Japanese American Farm Acreage in CA
* Jap. did well while they were here
* A lot of success \& upward mobility → drove reactionary land laws (who has
    access/exercise rights to land)
* Initially passed in CA, spread to other states (never federal level)
* 1913: California Alien Land Laws (can't lease land more than 3 years), but $\exists$ loopholes
    * 1920 prohibited all leasing of land
* Alien land laws created tenuous situation → loopholes allowed exploitation
    * Agreements w/in Jap. American community, rotate lease holdings
    * Own/lease land under names of American children
    * Form land corporation w/ whites, owned $<$ 50\%
    * Very successful, local authorities didn't enforce law
    * Engaging in process of developing land

## Early 20th Century Japanese American Agriculture: How did they do it?
* Timing very important
    * Period of innovations in agricultural tech. (groundwater pumping →
        opening land)
* Development of seeds, increase yields/productivity
    * Grow strawberries in Monterey etc.
* Focus on specialty crops → bring to markets, vertically integrated
    production/distribution chain
    * Seedlings/seeds from Japanese owned nurseries, growing crops on
        leased/owned farms
        * Sold back to Japanese markets
* Access to middle class market with demand for crops
* Labor intensive farming
    * Niche production w/in enclaves
        * Prospector capitalists developing resources
        * Takaki → "Cultural/ethnic solidarity", credit pooling, exchange of
            knowledge/tools, farmer's association, vertically integrated chain
            * Family formation \& role of women key
                * Short term need for work → leverage family/community
                    (planting/harvesting time)
                * Don't eat as much that year → can absorb

## Jap. American \& Chinese American experiences
* Divide/control labor market
    * Capital segmenting labor force, pit against one another in terms of
        ethnic identities
* Chinese come at time where opportunities not available for small scale
    entrepreneurship
    * Opportunities didn't open up until CA agriculture took off
* Nature of community resources, support of Jap. gov't
* Financial resources/family formation
