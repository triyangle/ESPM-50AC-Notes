# 2/20/19
## Northeastern Woodlands tribes
* Deciduous/coniferous forest of northeastern woodlands
* Climate: precipitation/soil maps
    * CT river valley → sedimentary/fertile soil

### Spatial & Temporal Diversity
* Fall → leaves fall → hunting
* Seasonal forests burning → open pasture
    * Shorter cycle than regular forest growth → lightning

## Modes of Production
* Subsistence agriculture, hunter/gatherer mode of production
    * Only as necessary, maybe a little surplus for trade
* Seasonal pattern
    * Agriculture in fertile lowland, fishing, etc. during spring/summer
    * Hunt in higher ground during fall/winter

# 2/22/19
* Usufruct in conflict w/ de jure systems of colonial law

## Corn - bean - squash horticulture
* Polyculture → overlap harvest cycles
* Squash thorns guard against animals
    * Shades soil → retaining moisture
* Corn hard on soil, depletes nutrients
    * Burn corn stalks → recycle nutrients
* Corn stalks allow bean vines to climb on
* Beans nitrogen fixing → ↑ soil

### Shifting Agriculture
* AKA slash/burn
* Annual burning important in fallowing → sustaining ecosystem

### Human needs
* 90% coming from corn/bean/squash
* Diversity of food products/crop reduce risk
* Women = carrier of agriculture knowledge
* Corn kernels saved selectively (larger kernels) → modify gene pool
* North → shorter growing season → select kernels from lower parts of stalk →
    faster germination

### Social Org.
* Women in charge of food production in summer (food production/agriculture)
* Men prepare for winter hunt → burn out understore/growth for good hunting
    grounds → opens up light for berry bushes, etc. & assists reproduction of
    grasses
    * Burning = primary tool to manage landscape
* No use of metals in hunting/farming (potential larger impact in
    agroecosystems)
* Reproduction = sustaining production
* Lineage traced via women's side of family, name/wealth passed down
    maternally, (materlineal?)
* Production oriented for & made possible/sustained reproduction
    (biological/agricultural/forest/kinship/cultural/social/etc.)
    * Production depends on reproduction, can't undermine reproductive capacity
        of ecosystem

## Traditional Ecological Knowledge
* Avoid risk by adapting to & reproducing natural systems while modifying them (moderately) to human needs
* Cultural beliefs rationalized/normalized forms of behavior and social order to sustain social/ecological systems
* Cosmology → role of human w/ nature
* Northeastern woodlands → nature animate, intrasubjective → no separation of
    nature w/ culture
* Nature infused w/ spiritual value
* Factual observations → management systems
* Intrasubjectivity fundamental to culture/identity
* Changes/adapts with events/etc.

### Myths
* American dream → myth connected to truths
    * Secular myth
* Ascensionist narrative structure → emphasizes good morals
* Declensionist → warning not to stray from morals

#### Corn Mother Myth
* Shared by many tribes, Indian mother figure bringing corn/tobacco and how to
    grow/sustain production for sake of reproduction
* Grounded in TEK (traditional ecological knowledge)
* Guidelines for doing things
* Conveys values/etc.
* Naturalizes/rationalizes lineal order of society
* Regulated relationships between people/society → production → reproduction
    * Culture evolving symbiotically ally w/ production system (mode of prod.)
        * Changing under circumstances as required
* Moral = listen to your mother

# 2/25/19
## English colonists
* See nature in terms of commodities
    * As opposed to natives viewing nature in more intrasubjective manner
        (subsistence/survival)
* Colonists → extract/accumulate commodities from land
    * Oriented for production in marketplace
* Reclamation of forests → pastures
* Enclosure of the commons → common land around villages privatized
    * Land used for herding sheep/agriculture/etc.
    * New crops/cropping system → continuous use of crops from one field (don't need
        rotation system) → higher yield of larger acreage → market
    * Little fallowing/long rotation of fields → increase marketplace yield
* Introduction of animals → linchpin of modern production of agriculture
    * More tilling
    * Ate leftovers from harvest → fertilizer/manure
    * Reason for clearing large forest areas into pastures
* Single grain monocultures adversely affected soil quality
    * Loss of potassium/nitrogen not cycled back in
    * Manure/fish used as fertilizer
* Decline in productivity of soil → soil mining
    * Possible resolution = burn forest, bring ashes in for fertilizer
* Introduction of metal based tools important
* Logic of decision making shifted from community to individual, not much sense
    of obligation from individual to community
    * Burning forest understore vs burning entire forest
        * Hunting for everybody vs raising sheep for one person
* Abstract land into surveyable/modifiable units
* Soil mining undermines reproduction system
    * Production system undermines ecological bases of reproduction (e.g. soil
        quality)

### Tenure System
* Kentish tenure system

## Colonial & early Republic ideas about nature
* Protestantism → individual's relation to god as moral compass, godly
    community
* Wilderness inferior position to society
    * Morally less than culture
    * God gives gift of nature to humans to cultivate to please god
        * Humans act on nature to fulfill god's will → dominion over
            nature/people assoc. w/ nature/wilderness
    * "Noun that acts like an adj." –Nash
* Nature seen as object to be conquered/transformed, exercising right to
    dominion over nature

## Thomas Cole. The Oxbow (1836)
* Philosophical roots of romanticism
* Seeds of environmental movement
    * Undisturbed nature in positive light
    * Uncertainty/ambulance about what's better/worse
* Losing something via transformation of nature to settlements
* Romantic idea of sublime
* Transforming/domesticating nature → problematic
* Early transcendentalists

# 2/27/19
## Beavers
* 2nd largest rodent
* 30—90 million in North Am.
* Hats made out of beaver fur

### Riparian (river) ecological succession cycle
* Dam → lake → sediment → wetland → trees for beaver dams again

## Fur trade as int'l phenomenon
* Fur trade = international phenomenon (Europe/global phenomenon of extracting
    resources from colonies), w/ long hist. → indigenous people in commodity
    exchange in context of great power geopolitics
* Spain withdrawing as dominant sea power → opportunity for settlements open in
    N. Am.
* Labor: native tribes used as proxy armies
* Fur trade = means of controlling territory via gaining indigenous/tribal
    allies
    * Provide labor for military, raw material extraction
    * Consumers of European goods
    * Global politics

### Mercantilism
* High vol. & pos. balance of trade
* More exports than imports
* Colonies supply raw materials to home country → manufactures/sells everywhere → controlling territory, protectionism
* Crisis of reproduction driven by repeated extraction

* Nexus of state (mil. power, etc.), capital (from global/Europe mainly via
    extraction of resources from Americas), labor (Native Americans, also
    consumers)
* End of fur trade → changing times/fashion (emergence of silk industry via
    British control of Malaysia)
    * Not so much lack of beavers

## Indian tribes & incorporation into fur trade
* Natives = labor kinship based (subsistence horticulture/hunter-gatherer mode of
    production)
* Market based influence on division of labor
* Introduction of new tech.

### Tribes
#### Coastal Abenaki
* 10,000 → 3,000 via smallpox
* Full-time hunting instead of mixed hunter/gatherer
* Late 1600s → pushing up against territorial boundaries of other tribes
* Women supporting hunt → initially losing all status → new area, back to
    growing corn/bean/squash
    * Lost most of traditional cultural practices
    * Adopted Catholicism

#### Huron/Iroquois
* Huron historically middle-men → far northern reaches of land where possible
    to grown corn/bean/squash → history of trading w/ northern tribes for
    fur/etc.
    * Alliances w/ other tribes & French
        * Proxy army for French against British
            * Dominated tribes to west
    * Served as middle-men → buyers
    * Dominated other tribes to make them hunt for furs for them, Huron sold to
        French
* Iroquois = clients of British (confed. of 5–6 tribes)
    * Trained by British, defeated Huron
    * Warred w/ neighboring tribes (beaver wars)
    * Successful militarily but not many people → many men killed in battle
        * Women brought men from defeated tribes back
            * Women had enhanced role/status (b/c they were Iroquoian and men
                not)
                * Also not displaced so continued growing corn/bean/squash
* Fox, Sauk, Potawatami, Ottowa
    * Stake out/fight over territories
    * Ojibwa = congregation of smaller tribes

## Native American societies & fur trade
* Tribes lost social org./reprod.
* TEK → loses much of value → cultural reprod. more difficult → dependency of
    tribes (on colonizers, inability/lack of ability for reproduction)

# 3/1/19
## Clicker
* (C) Middle ground

## Comp. New England Colonists & Native American
* Lockean conquest of people & landscapes
* Diff. perspectives offer rationale/critique of colonization
* Native American resources practices sustainable or higher dimensional?
* Natives in California didn't grow corn/bean/squash → abundance of other
    resources/biodiversity

## Anderson: (**Tending the Wild**)
### Harvest Strats.
* Sustain ecosys. nutrients/soil fertility
* Baregrass
    * Essential part of life stages, burning cycles
* Ethos of caring about species and species management
    * Reciprocal relationship w/ nature, inttrasubjective
* Keep ecosys. in modest/intermediate level of disturbance → Native Americans
    lived in eco. harmony w/ nature

## Krech on Indian Fire
* Metanalysis, lit. review
* Fire out of control, not extinguished (esp. in grasslands)
* Leaving parts of buffalo behind common

### Krech: **The Ecological Indian: Myth & History**
* Anachronistic (using contemp. terms to describe something from past, but
    don't capture reality)
* Essentialist (ecological = essence of their nature)
* Social construction of natives as ecologists

#### Not Conservationist
* Let many hides behind, etc.
* Took what they wanted, left rest
* Secular moral imperative → Lockean optimization of use of resources
* Kept hunting buffaloes

#### Conclusions
* Didn't embody ecology/conservation

# 3/4/19
## Clicker
* Anachronism = defining past in terms of present (Krecht describing natives)

## Manifest Destiny
* Putting religious concepts in more secular context

## Context of expansionist ideology
* Crisis of reprod. in New England

## Turner's Thesis
* Frontier = basic process by which American identity formed
    * Based on Agrarian myth & manifest destiny
    * Wilderness masters colonist, but through hard work colonist is able to
        master wilderness → American identity
        * Qualities as a result incl. lack of artisticness
        * Mobility always dominant factor
* Universalist vs inclusionist (Turner)

# 3/6/19
## Clicker
* Property = rights to things, but need to be legitimate

## Image and social construction of Native Americans

* Bierstadt romanticism
* Trained in Hudson River School (Cole, Oxbow)
* Luminism art style (brightness)

    * Cathedral-like quality
* Individual = focus, not collective

### Charles Bird King - Young Omahaw, War Eagle, Little Missouri, and Pawnees (1822)
* Negotiations w/ gov't officials
* Noble → Roman noses, free from depravities of city life
    * Roman noses → (neo)-classicism → speaking to higher moral plane
    * Distant stare
* Medallion = recognition of friendship (from federal gov't)
* Give ceremonial axe/tomahawk in exchange
* Savagery → paint/garb
    * Unpredictability
* Tension of nobility & savagery
* Nobility = gateway to potential for assimilation

### George Catlin - Clermont, Chief of the Osage (1834) /  Clermont’s wife (1834)
* Subjugation to portraiture process
* Individualism focus → western notion
    * Step toward assimilation
* Abstract naturalistic background → realm of savage
* Nuclear family → common shared humanity in motherhood

### George Catlin - Bird’s-eye View of a Mandan Village (1834)
* Paradise or mess?
* Collectivity embedded in nature
* Lazy (Natives) vs too industrious (white)
* Sentimental (storm clouds)

* Counter narrative, undoing hierarchy of past, social activism
* Haozous = self-identity
    * Philosophical cultural knowledge as guiding reference
    * "White man in olives"
    * Modern native identity formed by colonial hist.
* Self-rep. Bridging modern & trad.

# 3/8/19
* Beargrass need sunlight
* Commodified timber forest (oaks) vs basket weaving
* 1912 fire = criminal activity starting fires in forests

# 3/11/19
* Trust doctrine

## Trade & Treaties
* Colonial period → certain degree of equality
* Early treaties divide land, more amicable (not about moving off to
    reservations)
* Guardianship theory, white supremacist assumption
    * Whites = guardian to tribes (seen as ward of state)
    * Favoring interest of tribes

## Removal & Reservation
* Not much movement over Appalachians until after war of 1812 (1820s) →
    colonization of South & Upper Midwest
    * Shift from noble savage → brutal savage

## Johnson v. McIntosh
* Doctrine of discovery → sovereignty established via discovery
* Native tribes have rights to occupancy (despite not full rights)
* Complexity and divisibility of property rights implies tribal sovereignty
    rights
    * Possibility of tribal "impaired sovereignty"

## Cherokee Nation Cases
* Jackson = Jeffersonian agrarian populist
    * Open up West, give to people
    * Rid West of native people via violence/brutality and legal/extralegal
        means
* Gold discovered in Georgia, Cherokee land
    * Militia tried to drive Cherokee out
        * Georgia state law imposed on Cherokee territory (in addition to
            violence, etc.)
* Cherokee want standing to courts as sovereign nation
* Tribes = dependent domestic nation
    * Sovereignty divided between tribes, federal gov't, state gov't (i.e.
        "impaired sovereignty")

## Worcester v Georgia
* Limits ability of states to remove tribes
* Fed. gov't has fiduciary duty to look out for best interest of tribes
* Shifting interpretations of trust doctrine between wardship (dependent nations)
* Tension between wardship and sovereignty interpretations of trust
    doctrines

# 3/13/19
## Worcester v Georgia
* Georgia trying to push Cherokees out
* Jackson cedes de facto sovereignty to states

## Expansion, reservation, war and dependency
* Many conflicts, military tragedies
* Removal treaties remove tribes to less valuable land (interpretation of trust
    doctrine, keep tribes safe from whites)
* Homestead Act sets context for Allotment
    * \$1.25 an acre, agrarian myth, excluding Native Americans and forcing
        their removal
* Cycle of violence
* Discovery of gold in black mountains → conflict
* Land base of tribes lost tremendously
* Focus on separation (maybe assimilation later)
* CA → bounties put on Native people
* Many forms in which genocide played out
* Trust doctrine interpreted in wardship instead of sovereignty
* Tribes deprived of resources → limited capacity for (social) reprod.

## Tenure patterns on reservations
* Tribal reservation land not actually completely owned by tribes
* Lot of land owned by timber company and white landowners

## Allotment & Assimilation
* 1870s Protestant church leaders administered
    * 1882 BIA took over, church leaders had continuing interest/role
        * Tremendous corruption in allotment of land

## US v Kagama
* Upheld major crimes act
* Supreme Court found tribal sovereignty non-existent

## Social Construction and incorporation
* Assimilation depends on acculturation
* Alice Fletcher = leading church figure
* General Allotment Act → Magna Carta

## General Allotment (Dawes) Act
* Private property parcels of 160 acres
* Trust patent → trust doctrine, property held in trust by gov't
    * Protection from vicissitudes of market (demands of life in reg. economy)
* Private property ownership → incorporated into cash economy → pay taxes → may
    lose land quickly (sell land to pay taxes)
* Surplus land managed by gov't in trust for tribes
    * Land sold to private interest
* Trust doctrine interpreted as wardship as pathway to sovereignty
    * Citizenship → no longer subject to trust doctrine
* Not until 1934 all tribal members assimilated
* Increased dependency as a result of impoverishment from land loss
* 1934: 48 million acres → surplus land sales

# 3/15/19
## General Allotment (Dawes) Act
* Assumed acculturation of Natives
* Acculturation → assimilation via rearrangement of property rights
* No healthcare
* Integration in market economy → undermine tribes (social/cultural/biological)
    * Left in state of great dependency

## Indian New Deal
* Southern/Eastern European migrants not culturally/ethnically acculturated →
    ethnic enclaves
* Cultural pluralism → assimilation w/out full acculturation
    * Against Dawes ACT (acculturation before assimilation)
* Recognition that Indians not willing to shift completely to white ways
    * Potential for damage instead
* New Deal → fed. gov't essential to managing economy (Keynesian approach)
* Discrimination in New Deal against non-whites
    * Educational, food/subsistence programs
* Collier → get lost land from allotment back in Native hands
    * Increase native land holding, reach out to tribes
    * Goes on listening tour

## Indian Reorganization Act
* Key feature of Indian New Deal
* Allotment ended
* Allotted land in land → remain in trust, no conversion of trust patent land
    to fee patent
    * Victory for tribes: allotment → trust → fee patent = loss of land
* No more selling of surplus land
* Money to support institutions of tribal gov't
* Money dedicated to expand land for educational/vocational training
* Loss of land greatly slowed → buybacks
* Social services → stabilization of tribal community economies
* More dependency on fed. gov't for money in order for tribes to act as
    sovereign
* 1934 "Those powers lawfully vested in Indian tribe not delegated powers
    granted by express acts of Congress, but inherent powers of limited
    sovereignty never extinguished" -Ally of Collier
    * Right to take away sovereignty but not grant
        * Tribes = largely sovereign entities

## Termination
* Wardship = financial problem, draining treasury
* Rhetoric/ideology of Cold War → other, communistic
* House Concurrent Resolution 108 → initiated termination policy
    * Liquidation of reservations for self-sufficient tribes fit for social
        incorporation
        * Break up reservation → put land into tribal hands (allotment on grand
            scale)
    * Most tribes very resistant → limited effect of termination
* Terminated tribes had timber → some had vast extraction infrastructure
    * Targeted for timber land
    * Menomonee largely successful in getting land back
* Indian Relocation Act encouraged tribes to move to cities
    * Seen mostly in neg. light by many people → breaks up families/communities

## Self-Determination
* Tribes should be largely sovereign
* Termination not official overturned as official policy until Nixon
* No active administration until Kennedy
* Fades away in context of 1960s (civil rights, Indian red power movements)
* Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act → focus on sovereignty
    under fed. gov't
    * Tribes elevated → recognition of sovereignty, gov't to gov't relationship
    * Limitations → programs on land for social services, schools, natural
        resources mgmt., etc. but still operation under greater authority of
        federal law
        * Tribal standards for water quality vary from EPA → tribes have
            certain rights to determine own standards (e.g. cultural practices)
    * Amendments enhanced sovereignty
        * 1996 → federal gov't contract tribal resource agencies to manage
            forests, etc.
    * Policy tension → greater stress on sovereignty, but can be limited by
        regulatory laws (stronger regulations over time)
    * What degree are tribes dependent on federal gov't?
        * Issues of gaming/casinos (sought by tribes for financial relief)
* Social incorporation → tension w/in tribal societies & gov't between modern
    and more traditional elements
