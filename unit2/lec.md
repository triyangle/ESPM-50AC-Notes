## Northeastern Woodlands tribes
* Deciduous/coniferous forest of northeastern woodlands
* Climate: precipitation/soil maps
    * CT river valley → sedimentary/fertile soil

### Spatial & Temporal Diversity
* Fall → leaves fall → hunting
* Seasonal forests burning → open pasture
    * Shorter cycle than regular forest growth → lightning

## Modes of Production
* Subsistence agriculture, hunter/gatherer mode of production
    * Only as necessary, maybe a little surplus for trade
* Seasonal pattern
    * Agriculture in fertile lowland, fishing, etc. during spring/summer
    * Hunt in higher ground during fall/winter

# 2/22/19
* Usufruct in conflict w/ de jure systems of colonial law

## Corn - bean - squash horticulture
* Polyculture → overlap harvest cycles
* Squash thorns guard against animals
    * Shades soil → retaining moisture
* Corn hard on soil, depletes nutrients
    * Burn corn stalks → recycle nutrients
* Corn stalks allow bean vines to climb on
* Beans nitrogen fixing → ↑ soil

### Shifting Agriculture
* AKA slash/burn
* Annual burning important in fallowing → sustaining ecosystem

### Human needs
* 90% coming from corn/bean/squash
* Diversity of food products/crop reduce risk
* Women = carrier of agriculture knowledge
* Corn kernels saved selectively (larger kernels) → modify gene pool
* North → shorter growing season → select kernels from lower parts of stalk →
    faster germination

### Social Org.
* Women in charge of food production in summer (food production/agriculture)
* Men prepare for winter hunt → burn out understore/growth for good hunting
    grounds → opens up light for berry bushes, etc. & assists reproduction of
    grasses
    * Burning = primary tool to manage landscape
* No use of metals in hunting/farming (potential larger impact in
    agroecosystems)
* Reproduction = sustaining production
* Lineage traced via women's side of family, name/wealth passed down
    maternally, (materlineal?)
* Production oriented for & made possible/sustained reproduction
    (biological/agricultural/forest/kinship/cultural/social/etc.)
    * Production depends on reproduction, can't undermine reproductive capacity
        of ecosystem

## Traditional Ecological Knowledge
* Avoid risk by adapting to & reproducing natural systems while modifying them (moderately) to human needs
* Cultural beliefs rationalized/normalized forms of behavior and social order to sustain social/ecological systems
* Cosmology → role of human w/ nature
* Northeastern woodlands → nature animate, intrasubjective → no separation of
    nature w/ culture
* Nature infused w/ spiritual value
* Factual observations → management systems
* Intrasubjectivity fundamental to culture/identity
* Changes/adapts with events/etc.

### Myths
* American dream → myth connected to truths
    * Secular myth
* Ascensionist narrative structure → emphasizes good morals
* Declensionist → warning not to stray from morals

#### Corn Mother Myth
* Shared by many tribes, Indian mother figure bringing corn/tobacco and how to
    grow/sustain production for sake of reproduction
* Grounded in TEK (traditional ecological knowledge)
* Guidelines for doing things
* Conveys values/etc.
* Naturalizes/rationalizes lineal order of society
* Regulated relationships between people/society → production → reproduction
    * Culture evolving symbiotically ally w/ production system (mode of prod.)
        * Changing under circumstances as required
* Moral = listen to your mother

# 2/25/19
## English colonists
* See nature in terms of commodities
    * As opposed to natives viewing nature in more intrasubjective manner
        (subsistence/survival)
* Colonists → extract/accumulate commodities from land
    * Oriented for production in marketplace
* Reclamation of forests → pastures
* Enclosure of the commons → common land around villages privatized
    * Land used for herding sheep/agriculture/etc.
    * New crops/cropping system → continuous use of crops from one field (don't need
        rotation system) → higher yield of larger acreage → market
    * Little fallowing/long rotation of fields → increase marketplace yield
* Introduction of animals → linchpin of modern production of agriculture
    * More tilling
    * Ate leftovers from harvest → fertilizer/manure
    * Reason for clearing large forest areas into pastures
* Single grain monocultures adversely affected soil quality
    * Loss of potassium/nitrogen not cycled back in
    * Manure/fish used as fertilizer
* Decline in productivity of soil → soil mining
    * Possible resolution = burn forest, bring ashes in for fertilizer
* Introduction of metal based tools important
* Logic of decision making shifted from community to individual, not much sense
    of obligation from individual to community
    * Burning forest understore vs burning entire forest
        * Hunting for everybody vs raising sheep for one person
* Abstract land into surveyable/modifiable units
* Soil mining undermines reproduction system
    * Production system undermines ecological bases of reproduction (e.g. soil
        quality)

### Tenure System
* Kentish tenure system

## Colonial & early Republic ideas about nature
* Protestantism → individual's relation to god as moral compass, godly
    community
* Wilderness inferior position to society
    * Morally less than culture
    * God gives gift of nature to humans to cultivate to please god
        * Humans act on nature to fulfill god's will → dominion over
            nature/people assoc. w/ nature/wilderness
    * "Noun that acts like an adj." –Nash
* Nature seen as object to be conquered/transformed, exercising right to
    dominion over nature

## Thomas Cole. The Oxbow (1836)
* Philosophical roots of romanticism
* Seeds of environmental movement
    * Undisturbed nature in positive light
    * Uncertainty/ambulance about what's better/worse
* Losing something via transformation of nature to settlements
* Romantic idea of sublime
* Transforming/domesticating nature → problematic
* Early transcendentalists

# 2/27/19
## Beavers
* 2nd largest rodent
* 30—90 million in North Am.
* Hats made out of beaver fur 

### Riperian (river) ecological succession cycle
* Dam → lake → sediment → wetland → trees for beaver dams again

## Fur trade as int'l phenomenon
* Fur trade = international phenomenon (Europe/global phenomenon of extracting
    resources from colonies), w/ long hist. → indigenous people in commidity
    exchange in context of great power geopolitics
* Spain withdrawing as dominant sea power → opportunity for settlements open in
    N. Am.
* Labor: native tribes used as proxy armies
* Fur trade = means of controlling territory via gaining indigenous/tribal
    allies
    * Provide labor for military, raw material extraction
    * Consumers of European goods
    * Global politics

### Mercantilism
* High vol. & pos. balance of trade
* More exports than imports
* Colonies supply raw materials to home country → manufactures/sells everywhere → controlling territory, protectionism
* Crisis of reproduction driven by repeated extraction

* Nexus of state (mil. power, etc.), capital (from global/Europe mainly via
    extraction of resources from Americas), labor (Native Americans, also
    consumers)
* End of fur trade → changing times/fashion (emergence of silk industry via
    British control of Malaysia)
    * Not so much lack of beavers

## Indian tribes & incorporation into fur trade
* Natives = labor kinship based (subsistence horticulture/hunter-gatherer mode of
    production)
* Market based influence on division of labor
* Introduction of new tech.

### Tribes
#### Coastal Abenaki
* 10,000 → 3,000 via smallpox
* Full-time hunting instead of mixed hunter/gatherer
* Late 1600s → pushing up against territorial boundaries of other tribes
* Women supporting hunt → initially losing all status → new area, back to
    growing corn/bean/squash
    * Lost most of traditional cultural practices
    * Adopted Catholicism

#### Huron/Iroquois
* Huron historically middle-men → far northern reaches of land where possible
    to grown corn/bean/squash → history of trading w/ northern tribes for
    fur/etc.
    * Alliances w/ other tribes & French
        * Proxy army for French against British
            * Dominated tribes to west
    * Served as middle-men → buyers
    * Dominated other tribes to make them hunt for furs for them, Huron sold to
        French
* Iroquois = clients of British (confed. of 5–6 tribes)
    * Trained by British, defeated Huron
    * Warred w/ neighboring tribes (beaver wars)
    * Successful militarily but not many people → many men killed in battle
        * Women brought men from defeated tribes back
            * Women had enhanced role/status (b/c they were Iroquoian and men
                not)
                * Also not displaced so continued growing corn/bean/squash
* Fox, Sauk, Potawatami, Ottowa
    * Stake out/fight over territories
    * Ojibwa = congregation of smaller tribes

## Native American societies & fur trade
* Tribes lsot social org./reprod.
* TEK → loses much of value → culturla reprod. more difficult → dependency of
    tribes (on colonizers, inability/lack of ability for reproduction)

# 3/1/19
## Clicker
* (C) Middle ground

## Comp. New England Colonists & Native American
* Lockean conquest of people & landscapes
* Diff. perspectives offer rationale/critique of colonization
* Native American resources practices sustainable or higher dimensional?
* Natives in California didn't grow corn/bean/squash → abundance of other
    resources/biodiversity

## Anderson: (**Tending the Wild**)
### Harvest Strats.
* Sustain ecosys. nutrients/soil fertility
* Baregrass
    * Essential part of life stages, burning cycles
* Ethos of caring about species and species management
    * Reciprocal relationship w/ nature, inttrasubjective
* Keep ecosys. in modest/intermediate level of disturbance → Native Americans
    lived in eco. harmony w/ nature

## Krech on Indian Fire
* Metanalysis, lit. review
* Fire out of control, not extinguished (esp. in grasslands)
* Leaving parts of buffalo behind common

### Krech: **The Ecological Indian: Myth & History**
* Anachronistic (using contemp. terms to describe something from past, but
    don't capture reality)
* Essentialist (ecological = essence of their nature)
* Social construction of natives as ecologists

#### Not Conservationist
* Let many hides behind, etc.
* Took what they wanted, left rest
* Secular moral imperative → Lockean optimization of use of resources
* Kept hunting buffaloes

#### Conclusions
* Didn't embody ecology/conservation
