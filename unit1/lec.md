## Hurricane Katrina
* Funding for Louisiana levies cut repeatedly by both Dem. & Rep. Congress
    * Supposed to be done after ~13 years (only ~75% complete by 2005, 40 years
        later)
    * Funds diverted to more economically "productive" measures (i.e. port
        development)
* Saltwater inundation → ~200 sq. miles of wetlands lost
* ~3300 oil rigs by coast, oil pipes connect to wetlands → environmental
    effects
* Cancer Alley
    * Many low income African American, etc. communities resident
* 53 levy breaches in total
    * Water undercut beneath levies (more often than going over)
* Hurricane funneled in via canals
* Many oil spills
    * Many contaminants

## Analysis
### Humans & Nature
* **Instrumentalist**: humans view nature as an instrument
    * Active human subject, passive nature object

### Social Conditions
* Economic, historical, identity  ⃡ segregation
* Not having the resources for people to move

### Political Economy
* Government prioritizing economic vitality & efficiency
    * Bureaucracy
    * FEMA not prepared to deal with hurricane (later prepared for Florida
        (Hurricane Jackson?))
* Iraq War, Bush admin → not as concerned w/ lower income people of color

### Neo-liberalism
* Minimize gov't role in economy → let market play itself out
    * Illegitimize gov't in eyes of people
* "Starve the Beast" → undermine faith in gov't to solve issues
    * As a result, less funding for agencies like FEMA
* Fetishism of market → hire external subcontractors (capitalism), not gov't regulated
    * Maybe more efficient, but not as reliable/safe

### Nature
* City in swamp below sea level → not smartest idea
* Oil pipelining damaged wetlands abilities to absorb storm surges
* **Historical Amnesia**: Politicians avoid talking about how to improve
    infrastructure from past hurricanes/disasters, but more focus on improving
    economy
    * Economic development > public safety
* **Technocratic Hubris**
    * Technocrats trained scientifically, makes decisions independent of broad
        democratic process
    * Originated from progressive era
        * Decisions of national importance swayed by corrupt political
            processes → need experts making decision
    * Not much communication
    * Suboptimal
    * Not much talk about preserving wetlands
    * Misguided management policies when not taking diverse perspective into
        account

# 1/28/19
## Worster Analysis
* Nature strong impact/influence on history, etc.
    * Can lead to spatial patterns for uneven social/economic development
    * Geographical limitations/opportunities etc. as basis for society
* **Intersubjective**: Nature active subject as well (cf. **instrumentalist**)
    * Taking wetlands into account when building levies, etc.
* Levies divide nature from society/culture
* **Site**: Geographic location
    * Fertile, unstable flood soil
    * Floods sustain land
        * Deposit fertile soil
        * Recharge groundwater
        * Maintain land elevation
* **Situation**: Relative socioeconomic status
    * e.g. New Orleans by Mississippi → good location for port
* Wetlands absorb floodwater as groundwater
    * Vegetative buffer against storm surges

## Historical Development of New Orleans
* New Orleans developed using instrumentalist view → transform site to make most of
    situation
    * Pumps, levies, etc.
    * Not much consideration of inability to control nature
* Development on river banks deprives land of from recharging from flooding
* Resources of land exploited for commodities via slave labor
* Mixed cultural/racial geography, lots of cultural mixing, many free slaves
* Building on swamp, expanding city in 1893 → levies only approach (levies,
    canals, pumps) reclamation of swamps
    * Groundwater depletion as a result of less flooding
        * Subsidence
    * Transformation of landscape & racial geography of New Orleans → new
        social/racial geography reflecting segregation as a result of levy
        development
        * Whites in higher ground, African-Americans pushed to lower ground

# 2/4/19
* Remove rainwater via pumping out → groundwater leaves → subsidence

## Racial/Geographic Segregation
* Industrial environmental health hazards by ports/manufacturing sites
    * Blacks pushed to ports and low-lying back swamps
* Exclusionary practices, restrictive covenants forbid non-whites from
    buying/renting property, rising housing prices on better land
    * Led to 
* **Redlining:** Primarily non-white neighborhoods
    * Specify neighborhoods as high-risk areas for obtaining loans
    * Loans for mortgage 10x mortgage rate for white neighborhood
    * Systematic denial of capital/credit
* Post WWII → housing projects built for black neighborhoods
    * Low quality, built on poor land
* All led to increased racial/geographic segregation

## 1927 Mississippi River Flood
* Relieve pressure on Mississippi via dynamiting levees
* Flood Control Act of 1928 → Congress authorized money for levees/flood
    diversion on lower Mississippi River

* 64k miles of oil pipelines to mainland
    * Tunnel under wetlands, require construction of canals
        * Saltwater enters canals → get more wider → turns to open water

## MR GO
* Navigation channels for moving goods throughout region

* Instrumentalist societal approach to nature separates nature from culture
* Large loss of wetlands areas

## Fauborg Treme
* Civil Rights movement → white flight
    * Middle class black flight as well to Gentilly
* Hollowed out inner city of poverty

* Infrastructure allows for development
* Levee system key to creating spatial segregation by race/class
    * Associated w/ land reclamation development
* Jim Crow laws, etc. ↑ segregation
* Overlap of race/poverty

* "Levees only" separates nature and culture based on instrumentalist ideology
    of control over nature from exploitation of region
* Infrastructure didn't adapt to nature
* Illusion of safety while creating risk
* Landscape of racially differentiated risk

* 80% of flooded neighbors non-white/poor
* Lakeview neighborhood exception to racial/risk gradient
* Instrumentalist lens denies nature's active role

* Impossible to separate environmental/social in New Orleans (Kellman)

## Omi & Winant
* Synthesizing across wide range of academic fields
* Delegitimize argument that Civil Rights movment was success → post racial
    society

### Racial Formation
* Self-perception and perception of others

# 2/6/19
## Omi & Winant: Racial Formation Theory
* Interpretation, representation, explanation of racial dynamics
* Assigning meaning and situating meaning in social structures

### Racial Projects
* Slavery, Jim Crow Laws, redlining, Third World Liberation Front, Harlem
    Renaissance, Trump wall \& travel ban, affirmative action

* Racial "common sense" derives from racial social structure
* American-ness historically defined in terms of whiteness

### Power
* Racial formation plays out via power laden socioeconomic structures, etc.
* Weber → power = exercise of the will
    * No ethical dimensions, i.e. "regardless of the basis"
* Power is multidimensional, e.g. setting agendas
    * No reparations in U.S. b/c power keeps it out of agenda and minds of
        people
* Shapes way people think about things and racial common sense

# 2/8/19
## Power & Hegemony
* Gramsci communist opposer of Mussolini fascism
    * Creation/manufacturing of consent
    * Creating consent of governed by preventing them from questioning
        political/socio-economical foundations of those systems via distributing just
        enough benefits (i.e. American dream, etc.)
* Those w/ power (political, economic, racially based, etc.) remain in power by
    reproducing power relations
    * Contrary to racial dictatorship by shaping perceptions, ideology & agenda
        (maybe not intentionally/consciously) instead of active
        violence/oppression
        * e.g. media, education
* Racial common sense accomplished via hegemonic narratives
    * American dream (working hard)
* e.g. American dream, nuclear families competing w/ one another → market based competitive economy
* Radical civil rights view Civil Rights gains as hegemonic
    * Fundamental structural barriers to economic mobility not fully addressed
* Omi & Winant: political opposition → refusal of common sense understanding that
    hegemonic order imposes

## Media Rep. of Hurricane Katrina
* Katrina ~2 years after bombing of Baghdad, etc.
* Militaristic overtones of media depiction
* Racial and gender coding of order vs disorder
* Woman wrapped around American flag
    * Responsibility of individual to look after themselves vs responsibility of
        community to look after everyone?

# 2/11/19
## Rebuilding Resilient City
* Social justice implications playing out across scale
    * Consider implications of people outside city and people who may be displaced

## City Planning
* Different stakeholders & interests coming together to plan

### Green Infrastructure
* Capture water and percolate it into ground
    * Refill groundwater
* Cost = maybe mosquito control issues
* Lowest lying areas → green space
    * Cost = displacement of people

### Waterfront Redevelopment
* Investment in potential valuable assets (most appreciable assets)
    * Tourist site

### MR-GO
* Flood wall preventing hurricane funnel effect

### Bonnet Carre' Spillway
* Takes fresh water & sediment to rebuild area to protect New Orleans from
    floods
    * Changes salinity levels of Lake Pontchartrain & Lake Born
* Disturbs current ecosystem of shrimp/fishing
    * Ecosystem adapted to current salinity level

### Geography of Resiliency
* Some areas still susceptible to flooding (if not more)
    * Gentilly, New Orleans east
    * Lower income, displaced people
* New landscape of racially differentiated risk but at larger scale
    * For entire New Orleans metropolitan area

## Post-Katrina Demography & Geography
* New Geography of race & class in city

### Population Density Change
* ~1.3 million people requested displacement assistance

### Demographic Change
* Recovery rate reflecting previous inequities
* Recovery working well for middle class whites
    * Many new incomers middle class white, non-African American
* Many middle class blacks fleeing
* Reproduction of old patterns in new spatial geography

## Uneven Recovery
* New Orleans received federal stimulus for small/local businesses →
    entrepreneurship

### Gentrification
* White middle income areas pushing against historical areas

### Public Housing
* Section 8 voucher → used for subsidized housing
    * Displacement from public housing in nice areas to further away, risk of
        eviction
        * New areas have little opportunity compared to old public housing

# 2/13/19
## Market-based, neo-liberal feformist approach → substantive but uneven
outcomes in rebuilding New Orleans
* A

## Tenure Terminology
* Not objects themselves, but rights/etc. to those objects

### Tenure
* Rules, laws, customs for allocation of property

### Sovereignty
* Popular sovereignty in the U.S.
* Decide tax, war/peace, property rights
    * Legitimator of property/human rights

## Types of Property
### Private
* Corporations, non-profit orgs included
* Excluding others from claim to something
    * Not completely exclusive (e.g. may allow gov't access for certain
        situations)
* Separation of private from social whole
* Private = taken from and claimed from social whole
    * Social process
* Opposed by those deprived of benefits and subject to costs of private
    property
* Collective may still have rights to object

### State
* Form of private property

### Common
* Community have large degree of control over object of property rights

## Property Rights & Obligations
* Use rights → rights to use something as specified by holder of control rights
* Informal property rights (de facto) not officially recognized by official
    tenure system, but may be recognized by customs/communities, etc.
* Right of street → collective claim to public space

## Macpherson
* Hegemonic function to property (rights)

# 2/15/19
## Locke
* Balance liberty (individual/market in public market sphere) & restraint
    * Social contract → liberal democratic order
        * Liberty/freedom of action in market (economy), politics (self-expression),
            conscience → rights
* Laws bind social contract together
* Market should be unencumbered by monarchical privilege

## Religion
### Universalist Catholicism
* Emphasis on 2nd table of 10 Commandments

### Individualist Protestantism
* Individual's reflection on relationship w/ God → moral direction, focus on
    1st table of 10 Commandments
* Godly community bound by each member's behavior
    * Prototype of citizenship
    * Property = morally righteous behavior, success, hard work
* Nature = God's gift to man to use
* Humans can't serve God's will in system of common property → seek alternative
    that doesn't waste God's gift (moral flaws → waste God's gift)
    * Private property → flawed soul

### Natural Law
* Humans have natural right to body/survival
* Realization of individual = realization of God's will

### Labor theory of value
* Central to foundations of political economy
* Labor key to realizing God's will by making nature productive
    * Labor not nature creates value for man

### Property Rights
* Accumulation of wealth → represents characteristics Godly community exhibit

## Declaration of Independence
* Jefferson didn't want to emphasize "possessions" → used "pursuit of Happiness"

## American Social Contract
* Relationship between individual and collective inside social contract and those outside social
    contract

### Possessive Individualism
* How to allocate rights to land in public West?
    * Rights of individual should be protected at all costs (right to operate
        freely in market/public as basis of meritocratic system)
        * Should be able to buy as much land as you want
* Society has obligation to protect rights of individual

### Populist Agrarianism
* Focuses on equitable distribution of land to white males
* Basis of broad democracy

* Both act hegemonically
    * Not successive in possessive individualism → not in social contract
