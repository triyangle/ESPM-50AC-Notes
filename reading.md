# Unit 1
## Week 3
### [Hegemony - 10 Minute Philosophy - Terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js8E6C3ZnJ0)
#### Gramsci
* Power wields people

#### Bourdieu
* Identity given to you by society

## Week 4
### Locke
* Property initially derived from labor
    * Natural land available to all, but through labor people can claim
        exclusive rights over it
    * Wasting/spoiling resources = infringing on others property rights
* Money came about as a more permanent and durable way to hoard up resources
    (doesn't spoil → not infringing on others rights)

### Models of social incorporation in American society
* After 1960s → end of white Anglo Saxon Protestant hegemony/cultural dominance
    * Core of American popular culture & society organization still grounded in it

#### Assimilation
* Economic opportunity (economic), voting rights (political), etc.

* Core inside group originally white Anglo Saxon Protestant

#### Assimilationist Models
* Irish initially discriminated against (described as "not-white")
    * Were able to overcome

##### Universalist
* Acculturating to new American identity, beyond exclusively white Anglo Saxon Protestant

#### Pluralist Models
##### Cultural Pluralism
* Truly American society w/ assimilation and *tolerance* (not celebration) of
    cultural diversity
    * Tolerance most cases limited to European cultural diversity
* No acculturation

##### Multiculturalism
* First in Australia/Canada, then U.S.
* Embracing/celebrating diversity instead of just tolerating

### Macpherson
#### 1
* Property = man-made institution which creates & maintains certain relations
    between people
* Perceptions are both effect and cause of what property "is" at any time
    * Property is both an institution & a concept
        * Over time institution & concept influence each other
* Can't say much of general validity about what property is
* Mixed definitions of property
    * Common usage: *things*
        * Byproduct of particular historical circumstances → already growing
            obsolete
    * Law/writers: *rights* in/or to things
        * Treated w/ most modern writers as identical w/ *private* property
            (*exclusive* individual right)
            * Right to exclude others from use/benefit of something
                * Byproduct of particular historical circumstances
* Macpherson: both usages are misusages unequal importance
    * One is popular misuse of word → not necessarily misunderstanding, but
        maybe sign of limited understanding of what property is
    * Other one more serious → genuine misconception → affects whole
        theoretical handling of concept of property by many modern writers
    * Both trace back to ~ same period (rise of full capitalist market society)
        * Becoming/likely to become obsolete
    * Property in both law/logic = rights not things
    * Concept of property cannot logically be confined to private property
    * Always need for justificatory theories of property, generally include
        property in both consumable means of life and in land/capital/labor

#### 2
* Distinction between property & physical possession → define property as right
* Property = right → enforceable claim to use/benefit of something
    * Right to share in common resource
    * Individual right
    * Enforced by society/state/custom/convention/law
* Existing set of property rights morally contentious
* Property not right because it is an enforceable claim — it is an enforceable
    claim only because prevailing ethical theory holds it a necessary human
    right
* Historically/logically, property = right in sense of enforceable claims
    * Popular usage diverged from this in last few centuries (appears to be
        temp.)
* Property enforceable claim → political relation between persons
* Modern private property: self right to exclude others from something
* Common property: right of individual not to be excluded from something

#### 3
* Common rights are individual rights → property of individuals not of state
* Corporate property = extension of individual private property
* State property doesn't give individual direct right to use nor right to be
    excluded from assets held by state
    * Not individual right not to be excluded
    * Corporate right to exclude → corporate private property
    * State = smaller body of persons authorized to command citizens
* Corporate property → exclusive property
* Common property → non-exclusive property

#### 4
* Notion of property as thing began in late 17th century, not likely to outlast
    twentieth
* Through 17th century, property understood as right in something
* Rise of full capitalist market economy from 17th century on → property =
    things
    * Replacement of old limited rights in land/other valuable things by
        unlimited rights
        * Diff. = previously unsaleable rights in things now saleable, not that
            things rather than rights in things being exchanged
* Beginning of 20th century → property seen as right to revenue rather than
    specific material thing
    * Property of shareholders = right to revenue from corporation

#### 5: Misconception of Property as Private Property
* Prob. take longer to disappear b/c not because has longer history, but more needed by market society
* Identification of property w/ private property around 17th century
* Existence of private property → contentious moral issue
* Private property attacked by Plato as incompatible w/ good life for ruling
    class
    * Defended by Aristotle as essential for full use of human faculties → more
        efficient use of resources
* Common property advocated as ideal
    * Primitive condition of mankind
* Jean Bodin: no common property → no sense of community → no viable state
    * No private property → no appreciation of common property
* Full capitalist market society 17th century → notion of common property ↓
    * "Common property" → contradiction in terms
* 16th/17th century on → more land/resources in settled countries → private
    property → individual right unlimited in amount, unconditional on
    performance of social functions, freely transferable → present day
* Modern right cf. feudal right → absolute right
    * Right to dispose of/alienate & to use
    * Right unconditional on owner's performance of any social function
    * Needed to let capitalist market economy operate
* Market no longer expected to do whole work of allocation
    * State ↑ work of allocation
        * Property as exclusive alienable, 'absolute' individual/corporate
            rights in things less necessary
            * Less demonstrably necessary to work of allocation, harder to
                defend as essence of property
